# maxx-energy
Hosts the source code of the Maxx Energy Website.
- maxx-energy-portal: Angular Frontend
- maxx-energy-backend: Express Backend

## Prerequisites
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version ^18.19.1 or newer.
2. Install the [Angular CLI](https://angular.dev/tools/cli/setup-local#install-the-angular-cli).


## Run Projects locally
If using VS Code, just hit F5 (run and debug). This runs both projects and allows for backend debugging.\
Otherwise, to run both projects locally: in the maxx-energy directory, type ```npm run dev``` in the terminal.
This will not enable debugging though.

Although possible to change in the future, the following endpoints are probably going to be accurate.
- Angular frontend: http://localhost:4200
- Express backend: http://localhost:3000
